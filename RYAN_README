I downloaded the diffs from http://st.suckless.org/patches/scrollback
but the last one didn't work. I tested just the first two and the
result worked as expected (shift needed to scroll) so I made what 
seemed like the right edit based on what's in the last diff, leaving a
for loop that the patch didn't expect to be there, there. 

That didn't work. So I tried removing that for loop: that didn't work.
Looked at the other diffs and that for loop was added by one of them.

Eventually realized that the shift part of the scroll was part of the config.
So, once I actually set the scroll to not require the shift button I could
apply the last patch manually again and Voila! It works.
